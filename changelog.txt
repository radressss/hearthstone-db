wholeCell variable is a variable taken from everyCard and all the files merged into one cell array

I did not include ‘debug’ in the wholeCell and I do not understand what it is.

I also did not include missions because I only need cards that can be played directly

cards.json is a file taken from the github files of hearthstone tracker.com

cards.json changed to cardsOLD.json then another version of it downloaded from:

https://github.com/ducino/hearthstone

now I have just realized that it has not been updated for more than a year so ill look for a better version
